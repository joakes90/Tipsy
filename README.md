#Create App with Watch kit extention that tracks BAC and plugs into HealthKit
### Why make a Watchkit extention
*	It's the new hotness
*	Quick and easy to be reached by drunks in socal situations where it's inapproprate to frequently check your phone
### Why have the app plug into Helthkit data
*	Apple loves HK and showing off things that utilize it.
	-		This increases chances of being featured
*	A BAC section that has no data sources already exists in the Health App.
## Features and things needed of the app
###	iOS App
*	Screen that lets you configure what you drink
	-			3.2% Beer
	-			6.0% beer
	-			Cocktails 
	-			mixed drinks
	-			shots 
	-			etc
*		 A class that keeps track of current BAC and reports it to Helth kit
*		 Have the level decrees over time when new drinks are not added
*		 First time set up screen to colect info like weight and gender for calculating BAC
*		 background color changes from Green at .0 to Yellow at.04 and Red at .08 and beyond.
*		 provides notification that alerts you if you are too drunk to drive 
	-			 should provide a good legal disclamer in app description that the app should not be used to decide if you should drive or not and always use best judgement etc.
*		 notification should offer to call and uber or lyft. (look into posibility of looking up and calling local taxis
* Display BAC
### Watch Kit Extention
*	Share curent BAC with phone so you can update and see current status in both places
* Pulls drinks you drink from phone
* One screen per drink on watch
* Watch background changes from Green-Yellow-Red at same rate as phone
* Try to call Uber or lyft from watch notification as well
* Display BAC
